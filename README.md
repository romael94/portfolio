Portfolio Webpage using Python 3 and Django Framework
***In Progress**
Webpage serves as my personal resume.
I built it from a bootstrap template found on getbootstrap.com
Currently working on ways to improve.

***Run Instructions***
I used Python 3 to create this Project

1. Open project folder with power shell
2. Use command '''python manage.py runserver''' to run local server
3. Powershell will display the link to the local server, enter the link into a web browser, and the webpage will appear.
